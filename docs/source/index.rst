K3D-jupyter Documentation
===========================

K3D-jupyter is a `Jupyter Notebook`_ 3D visualization package.

The primary aim of K3D-jupyter is to be an easy 3D visualization tool,
designed with native interoperation with existing powerful
libraries such as PyVista_, without being strictly dependent on them.

K3D-jupyter plots ipywidgets_ assuring a perfect interaction of a browser-side widget with Python kernel by a proven and standardized protocol.
